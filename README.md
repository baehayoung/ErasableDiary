# ErasableDiary
A secret that you wanted to confide somewhere but couldn't bear to tell. Write it in a diary with a vaporizing pen. 
Like <strong>"the king's ears are like donkey ears".</strong>

## How it works
I used sessionStorage, a web storage object, to save the diary and make it disappear as soon as the browser tab ends.
